Process Notes for React State Study
=================================




About Process Notes
===================
"Process Notes" is a step-by-step workflow document that outlines the "phases" of my study/app development and the successive steps taken at each
milestone of the examination. In the case of studies, the process notes might be eschewed in favor of the main Readme document in the repository, 
mostly because of the advantage in formatting and accessibility. However, I will put additional notes and resource links that might be helpful. In 
the case of application development, groups of related steps are combined into "phase" modules so that they can be reorganized and refined in 
post-review. This has proven to be EXTREMELY helpful in learning (i.e. Feynman technique (https://fs.blog/2012/04/feynman-technique/)) and refining 
workflow so I can improve my process in future projects. It also has come in handy for some tricky bug fixes not only for past projects, but this 
one as well so I would urge you to consider at least doing a rough summary for your own benefit.



Objective of Study
==================
The objective of this study is to outline the process to create and render stateful components.
Component State
The component lifecycle
Event handlers




What is state?
==============

## State is the current condition of a component.
State is usually meant to describe the current condition something is in. 
React "state" is a feature that is used to chnage the current condition of a particular component.

For example, suppose we want to build a component that displays the date and time. (<TheDate />). Although you could solve this problem by passing in 
a prop for the date-time, this is inefficient because you would have to pass the date-time to the component from the parent every time it is rendered. 
Since the component needs to be self contianed, it needs to be responsible for its owen date-time. So instead of using props, we'll use state.
